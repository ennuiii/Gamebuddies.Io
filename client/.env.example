# Client environment variables
# If you need to override the socket server URL explicitly, set one of:
# REACT_APP_SERVER_URL or REACT_APP_GAMEBUDDIES_API_URL
#
# By default, the app connects to the current origin, which works for:
# - Production: hosted under the same domain as the server
# - Development: CRA dev server proxies WebSocket traffic to the backend

# Example (uncomment and adjust as needed):
# REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3033
# REACT_APP_GAMEBUDDIES_API_URL=http://localhost:3033
# Force Socket.IO transports order (useful on some hosts)
# REACT_APP_SOCKET_TRANSPORTS=polling,websocket
